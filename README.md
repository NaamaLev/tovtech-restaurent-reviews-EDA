## Identifying outlier periods based on customer ratings of restaurants - EDA project
In this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, we analyze a substantial dataset of restaurant reviews sourced from the Yelp website. The initial phase involves conducting thorough data integrity checks to ensure the reliability of the dataset. Subsequently, we filter the data to include only restaurants with sufficient user review data for comprehensive analysis.

The main focus of the project is the identification of outlier periods characterized by significant deviations in mean ratings compared to the preceding 6-month period. These outlier periods, around 3 weeks, are determined through the utilization of moving averages and standard deviation calculations for each business.

Then, the results are visualized through graphs, showcasing the outlier periods in relation to both the previous 6 months' average and other non-outlier 3-week periods. Additionally, for each outlier period, we highlight the reviews that most significantly influenced the ratings.

This analysis serves as a valuable tool for restaurant owners, providing insights into practices that contribute positively/negatively to ratings. By focusing on these findings, restaurant owners can enhance their understanding of customer experiences and refine their business practices accordingly.
